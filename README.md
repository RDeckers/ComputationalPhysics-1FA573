Each lecture is given its own folder. This folder includes a makefile which can take care of compiling, running, and plotting. In order to create all the relevant binaries run "make binaries", in order to generate the data files run "make data", and in order to generate any plots, run "make plots" or simply make all. The easiest way is of course to run make in this top-level directory which will make all subdirectories.

 Plotting is done with gnuplot and this should therefore be installed and part of the path.
